# EXPLANATION
# "Why do we use SUM(quantity*price) instead of SUM(quantity)*price?"
# In this question, we are using GROUP BY product. 
# The price of each individual product doesn't change. 
# That's why SUM(quantity*price) and SUM(quantity)*price, in this specific question, both give the same results.
